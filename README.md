# 🐝 Bumblebee: Fuzzing the Mind of AI and Machines

**Bumblebee** is an AI fuzzing tool that audibly and visually inspects transformer models to detect behavioral instabilities, layer by layer. Inspired by the sound of fuzzing and the buzz of bees, this tool helps researchers and engineers explore model robustness in a new light.


## 🚀 Features

- Hooks into HuggingFace transformer models
- Generates visual and JSON layer-level inspection reports
- Supports fuzzing across all attention and MLP layers
- Designed for research into interpretability and robustness

## 🔧 Usage

```bash
python bumblebee.py --model gpt2
